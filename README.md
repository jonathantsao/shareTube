# ShareTube

[ShareTube Live](https://sharetube.herokuapp.com/?#/)

ShareTube is a full-stack web application modeled after YouTube. It is built using Ruby on Rails, aPostgresql database, and React.js with a Redux framework on the frontend.

## Features and Implementation

### Video Player

### Comments and Likes



### Home Page Carousels


## Future Directions

With the features already implemented, I plan to continue working on the project with the following features.

### Channel Pages

 YouTube's site has channels with extensive information about a particular user's activity. I plan to add channels, allowing users to be able to see information about another user, such as their liked videos, subscriptions, recent uploads, etc.

### Recommendations

Part of what makes YouTube such a frequently visited site is its ability to offer recommendations to users. Usually, this is implemented using factors such as watch history, subscriptions, liked videos, etc. I plan to generate a simple relevance index that is able to used to generate recommendations to a user.
